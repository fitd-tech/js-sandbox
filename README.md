# js-sandbox

This is a repo meant to explore JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and other related concepts. Because many of the exercises here may be hardware intensive, this is meant to be run locally as opposed to hosting on a paid service.

Algorithms and other approaches in this repository are an exploration, and I have intentionally developed them from general explanations of concepts, at most times without referencing code examples. Because I have created these solutions organically from my own intuition, I have no expectation that I am presenting the optimal solution. However, as I gain understanding of a working solution, I will continue to refactor and refine. Please reference the commit history to see my progress.
